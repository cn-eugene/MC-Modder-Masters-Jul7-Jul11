# MC-Modder-Masters-Jul7-Jul11
Hello, families of these incredible Ninjas!

Thank you so much for an awesome week of modding Minecraft! This was by far my favorite camp that I ran this summer and I cannot thank you all enough for the 
amazing work you all put in. I seriously hope you all continue to work on your mods and improve your coding skills even further... or maybe just continue
to enjoy the fun of Minecraft!

This is the place where you will find the files for the mods that the Ninjas made while they were at camp. Each Ninja should find a file here along with the download instructions: one .ZIP file to be extracted and imported into MCreator in order for Ninjas to continue working on their mods

I hope that these instructions are helpful in the case that the Ninjas would like to continue their Minecraft modding journey. Please don't hesitate to reach out if you have issues accessing them. These Ninjas worked very hard and deserve to enjoy their creations long after this camp has ended. You can reach out at 541-WEEK-FUN or eugeneor@codeninjas.com and we will do our best to support you accessing your mods.

Thank you all once more for making this camp experience truly amazing. It was an honor to be your Sensei and I hope you all thoroughly enjoyed learning some of the basics to Minecraft 
modding. Just remember to have fun as you go forth in your coding journey!

- Sensei Will

# How to open your workspace into and install MCreator
	For further editing and adding to your mods you’ll have to recreate your workspace at home - here is how!
Download the Ninja’s ZIP folder from the Github

After it has been installed, extract your workspace zip file into a folder on your desktop, 

 Download MCreator from this link: https://mcreator.net/download
 
 After downloading, run the file and follow the installation steps.
 
Open Mcreator and click "Open Workspace"

Navigate to the extracted folder and open the .Mcreator file
	
 It might take a moment or two to load, but once it has you'll be free to access your workspace like before.
